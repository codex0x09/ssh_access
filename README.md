## Simple Inro:

You can generate a new SSH key on your local machine. After you generate the key,
you can add the public key to your account on GitHub to enable authentication for Git operations over SSH,
instead of using access Tokens, in which you'll use each time `user name` and `Access Token` (generated password via GitHub).
While using `SSH` we can easily do Git operations without each `push` doing `user name` and `complicated password`,
we can see this in the [Easy Way SSH](https://github.com/codex0x09/ssh_access/blob/master/easy_way.md).

`SSH` by default is secure, form its name `Secure Shell`, but we can make to become `Super Secure Shell`,
by adding another layer of security to the `SSH private key`, that is called `Passphrase`, it asks you to enter the `password`
each time you want to access your GitHub account to `push` or doing any changes to your account via the `SHELL`,
we can see this in the [Hard Way SSH](https://github.com/codex0x09/ssh_access/blob/master/hard_way.md).  
SSH is secure, but why we may need to add another layer of security ?  
Simply you may in public place, or for any reason you want to set a `Passphrase`(password) temporarily and then to remove it 
easily, you can do so by reading [Hard Way SSH](https://github.com/codex0x09/ssh_access/blob/master/hard_way.md).
